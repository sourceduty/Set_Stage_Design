Sourceduty doesn't work directly in filmmaking but it can create innovative concept ideas for movies. These ideas offer a foundation that filmmakers and storytellers can develop and bring to life on screen. Alex Aldridge likes to imagine and design these initial concepts as a source of inspiration for those in the film industry looking to tell new and engaging stories.

Opening Scene Concept ~ Aspect Ratio Transition
The scene starts with a low angle neorealistic close-up following everyday people walking on a city sidewalk. The inital camera is full-screen and wide angle.

The camera slowly rises to eye level and zooms in on the main character walking by himself on the sidewalk.

As the camera rises there is a transition from the full-screen and wide angle aspect ratio to a letter-boxed aspect ratio.
